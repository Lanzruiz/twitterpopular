


Assumptions

There is problem of the pulling data of likes..i don’t know why but i checked already the documentation 

$result->favorites_count



Done Differently

This version i implemented the sort function just to proved that sort can do better ranking of tweet by counting the retweet counts and re-arrange descending. Instead of using in points of retweet = 2 and favorite = 1. 


I have also able to pull the image url and put it into the tweets

  


To Speed the implementation

Good planning for the every task to do. Clear direction and good time estimation.


Struggle

Having problem pull up the likes of the tweets


Case 1:  http://grandtowercebu.com/ They don’t have time to install CRM in the website and its so expensive to have Good CRM to the server.

   Solution: I created a Mini CRM plugins on the wordpress that accepts deals, subscriptions, reservations, and messaging to the clients.


Case 2:  http://www.hospitalitydefender.com/ The apps needs to be realtime update on their customer about the blogs and marketing status.

   Solution: I implemented the realtime and good algorithm for web crawler to be accurate calculation of the marketing status and feedbacks of the customer plus the nodejs for the realtime.
